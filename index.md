# GROL

Go Repl Open Language is a small interpreted (for now) language implemented in Go.

Initially loosely based on Monkey from the Writing an Interpret in Go book.
See more on [github](https://github.com/grol-io/grol/). Or try the `wasm` version right below
(and we also have a [discord bot](https://github.com/grol-io/grol-discord-bot#grol-discord-bot)).
