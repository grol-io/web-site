# GROL

Go Repl Open Language is a small interpreted (for now) language implemented in Go.

Initially loosely based on [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) from the Writing an Interpreter in Go [book](https://interpreterbook.com) but fully re designed and reimplemented since.
See more on [github](https://github.com/grol-io/grol/). Or try the `wasm` version right below, type `info` for all the functions and keywords
(and we also have a [discord bot](https://github.com/grol-io/grol-discord-bot#grol-discord-bot) and it's used in [fortio](https://github.com/fortio/fortio#fortio)).

See [releases](https://github.com/grol-io/grol/releases) to get the command line version with and interactive repl, history, edit of previous lines, etc...

See the [butterfly](butterfly) demo of generating images from grol in wasm.
